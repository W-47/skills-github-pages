Hello guys and welcome to another writeup featuring linux priviledge escalation. This is an easy box on tryhackme and you can access it [here](https://tryhackme.com/room/cowboyhacker)

# OVERVIEW

Okay quick overview, so we will be trying to bruteforce ssh and get some credentials for the box. I had fun on it and I hope you will to so lets get to it.

# NMAP SCAN
First things first a quick nmap scan to check on the open ports.

From the results we can see some ports open. For example; port 21, 22 and port 80.

# FTP SERVICE.
Let us try and use the FTP service to  get into the machine since we can login as Anonymous.

Aah yes we can see some files on the system. We will use get to well get the files to our own machine. 

# BRUTEFORCING.
So next we will view the page that is hosted on port 80.

We don't get a lot here but maybe we can use the names here as a users.txt and maybe bruteforce a username.
We will also cat out the two file swe got. we can see that the locks.txt is actually a password list. The task.txt also gives us another name that can be the user.

So using hydra we can actually run **hydra ssh://ip -L users.txt -P locks.txt**

Boom! We have a hit!

# PRIVILEDGE ESCALATION.
So next we should try and get root priviledges. so first we shall do **sudo -l** and we see that we can run (/var/tar) as root.

So we shall hop over to [GTFO bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#Sudo) and copy that command out to our machine.

And there we have it. We are root.
